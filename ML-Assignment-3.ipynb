    "### What are ensemble techniques in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques involve combining multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance. The main idea is to leverage the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of individual models. Common ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain bagging and how it works in ensemble techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging** works by training multiple models (usually of the same type) on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions. Each subset is generated by bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the purpose of bootstrapping in bagging?\n",
    "1. **Bootstrapping:** This involves randomly sampling the training dataset with replacement to create multiple subsets. Each subset is called a bootstrap sample.\n",
    "2. **Training:** Multiple models are trained independently on these bootstrap samples.\n",
    "3. **Aggregation:** For classification, the predictions are typically combined using majority voting. For regression, the predictions are averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Bootstrapping in Bagging:**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap Samples:** Random subsets of the data are created through bootstrapping.\n",
    "2. **Feature Bagging:** At each split in the decision tree, a random subset of features is chosen, and the best split is found only among those features. This reduces correlation among the trees.\n",
